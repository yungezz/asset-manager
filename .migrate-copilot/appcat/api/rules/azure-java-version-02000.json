JDK on LTS version is recommended, i.e. **Java 8**, **Java 11** or **Java 17**.\n                            It is strongly recommended to plan and execute a migration strategy to upgrade your application to a newer supported Java version.\n\n                            * **Unsupported Java versions**: Azure supports Java 8, Java 11, and Java 17. Versions of Java older than Java 8 are not supported, which means you may encounter compatibility issues and security vulnerabilities.\n\n                            * **Security risks**: Older Java versions may have known security vulnerabilities that can expose your application and infrastructure to potential attacks. Migrating to a supported version ensures that you benefit from the latest security patches and updates.\n\n                            * **Long-term support**: Supported Java versions receive long-term support (LTS) from the Java community, including bug fixes and updates. Migrating to a supported version provides you with a stable and well-maintained platform for your application.\n                        </message>\n                        <link href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/java/openjdk/transition-from-java-8-to-java-11\" title=\"Transition from Java 8 to Java 11\"/>\n                        <link href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/java/fundamentals/java-support-on-azure#supported-java-versions-and-update-schedule\" title=\"Supported Java versions and update schedule\"/>\n                        <link href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/java/openjdk\" title=\"Microsoft Build of OpenJDK\"/>\n                        <link href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/java/fundamentals\" title=\"Java on Azure developer tools documentation\"/>\n                    </hint>\n                </iteration>\n            </perform>\n            <where param=\"v\">\n                <matches pattern=\"1\\.[0-7]\"/>\n            </where>\n        </rule>"}
