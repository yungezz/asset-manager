Consider using Azure Service Bus by Java SDK instead. \n\n                        * **Provision Azure Service Bus**: Create an Azure Service Bus namespace in Azure. Azure Service Bus provides reliable message queuing and publish/subscribe capabilities, serving as an equivalent messaging service to Amazon SQS.\n\n                        * **Update application code**: Modify the Java application's code to replace the AWS SDK calls with the equivalent Azure Service Bus client libraries and APIs. Update the code to authenticate and interact with Azure Service Bus using the Azure SDK for Java.\n\n                        * **Map SQS functionality** to Azure Service Bus: Understand the differences between Amazon SQS and Azure Service Bus and adjust your application logic accordingly. Map SQS concepts (queues, messages, visibility timeouts, etc.) to their Azure Service Bus equivalents (queues, messages, lock duration, etc.).\n\n                        * **Migrate queues and messages**: Plan and execute the migration of your queues and messages from Amazon SQS to Azure Service Bus.\n                    </message>\n                    <link href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/service-bus-messaging\" title=\"Azure Service Bus documentation\"/>\n                    <link href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/java/api/overview/azure/service-bus\" title=\"Azure Service Bus libraries for Java\"/>\n                </hint>\n            </perform>\n        </rule>"}
