Provision a database instance in Azure and configure the necessary connection string.\n\n                        * **JMS Destinations**: If your application utilizes JMS resources, such as message queues or topics, consider using Azure Service Bus as a messaging service. Create the necessary queues or topics in Azure Service Bus and use the appropriate connection details provided by Azure Service Bus.\n\n                        * **Mail Sessions**: If your application sends emails, consider using Azure Communication Services.

It enables you to centrally manage and store application settings and configuration data. When dealing with secrets or passwords in your Tomcat application, it is recommended to use Azure Key Vault to securely store and manage sensitive information.\n\n                        Review the Azure service offerings and choose the appropriate services for your specific needs.\n                    </message>\n                    <link href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/java/migration/migrate-tomcat-to-azure-spring-apps\" title=\"Inventory external resources\"/>\n                    <link href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/products\" title=\"Azure services\"/>\n                    <tag>tomcat</tag>\n                </hint>\n            </perform>\n        </rule>"}
