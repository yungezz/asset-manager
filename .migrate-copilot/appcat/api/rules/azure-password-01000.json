To enhance the security of your application, it is recommended to employ secure credential management practices.\n\n                        * **Azure Key Vault**: Utilize Azure Key Vault to securely store and manage your application's passwords and other sensitive credentials. Azure Key Vault provides a centralized and highly secure location for storing secrets, keys, and certificates.\n\n                        * **Passwordless connections**: You can provide an additional layer of security and convenience for accessing resources in Azure by eliminating the need for passwords. This way you can reduce the risk of password-related vulnerabilities, such as weak passwords or password theft.\n                    </message>\n                    <link href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault\" title=\"Azure Key Vault documentation\"/>\n                    <link href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/intro/passwordless-overview\" title=\"Passwordless connections for Azure services\"/>\n                    <link href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/java/migration/migrate-spring-boot-to-azure-spring-apps#inventory-configuration-sources-and-secrets\" title=\"Password found in configuration file\"/>\n                    <link href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/developer/java/spring-framework/configure-spring-boot-starter-java-app-with-azure-key-vault\" title=\"Read a secret from Azure Key Vault in a Spring Boot application\"/>\n                    <link href=\"https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.azure.spring/azure-spring-boot-starter-keyvault-secrets\" title=\"Azure Spring Boot Starter for Azure Key Vault Secrets\"/>\n                </hint>\n            </perform>\n            <where param=\"extensions\">\n                <matches pattern=\"(properties|yaml|yml)\"/>\n            </where>\n            <where param=\"password\">\n                <matches pattern=\"(password|pwd)\"/>\n            </where>\n        </rule>"}
