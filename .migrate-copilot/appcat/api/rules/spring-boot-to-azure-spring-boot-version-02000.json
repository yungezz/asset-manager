There are automated tools like Rewrite to help you with the migration.\n\n                        * **Address code compatibility**: Review your application's codebase for any potential compatibility issues with the target Spring Boot version. Update deprecated APIs or features, address any language or library changes, and ensure that your code follows best practices and standards.\n\n                        * **Test thoroughly**: Execute a comprehensive testing process to verify the compatibility and functionality of your application with the new Spring Boot version.
