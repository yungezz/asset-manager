Update the connection string, hostname, port, username, and password information accordingly.\n\n                        * Enable **monitoring and diagnostics**: Utilize Azure Monitor to gain insights into the performance and health of your Java application and the underlying Azure SQL database. Set up metrics, alerts, and log analytics to proactively identify and resolve issues.\n\n                        * Implement **security** measures: Apply security best practices to protect your Java application and the Azure SQL database. This includes implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms with passwordless connections and leveraging Microsoft Defender for Cloud for threat detection and vulnerability assessments.\n\n                        * **Backup** your data: Azure SQL provides automated backups by default. You can configure the retention period for backups based on your requirements. You can also enable geo-redundant backups, if needed, to enhance data durability and availability.\n                    </message>\n                    <link href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql\" title=\"Azure SQL documentation\"/>\n                    <link href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/dms\" title=\"Azure Database Migration Service documentation\"/>\n                    <link href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor\" title=\"Azure Monitor documentation\"/>\n                    <link href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud\" title=\"Microsoft Defender for Cloud\"/>\n                    <link href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/automated-backups-change-settings\" title=\"Change automated backup settings for Azure SQL Database\"/>\n                </hint>\n                <technology-tag level=\"INFORMATIONAL\">Microsoft SQL Driver</technology-tag>\n            </perform>\n        </rule>"}
