Update the connection string, hostname, port, username, and password information accordingly.\n\n                        * Enable **monitoring and diagnostics**: Utilize Azure Monitor to gain insights into the performance and health of your Java application and the underlying MariaDB database. Set up metrics, alerts, and log analytics to proactively identify and resolve issues.\n\n                        * Implement **security** measures: Apply security best practices to protect your Java application and the MariaDB database. This includes implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms with passwordless connections and leveraging Microsoft Defender for Cloud for threat detection and vulnerability assessments.\n\n                        * **Backup** your data: Azure Database for MariaDB provides automated backups by default. You can configure the retention period for backups based on your requirements. You can also enable geo-redundant backups, if needed, to enhance data durability and availability.\n                    </message>\n                    <link href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/mariadb\" title=\"Azure Database for MariaDB documentation\"/>\n                    <link href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/dms\" title=\"Azure Database Migration Service documentation\"/>\n                    <link href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor\" title=\"Azure Monitor documentation\"/>\n                    <link href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud\" title=\"Microsoft Defender for Cloud\"/>\n                    <link href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/mariadb/howto-restore-server-portal\" title=\"Backup and restore in Azure Database for MariaDB\"/>\n                </hint>\n                <technology-tag level=\"INFORMATIONAL\">MariaDB Driver</technology-tag>\n            </perform>\n        </rule>"}
