Update the connection string, hostname, port, username, and password information accordingly.\n\n* Enable **monitoring and diagnostics**: Utilize Azure Monitor to gain insights into the performance and health of your Java application and the underlying PostgreSQL database. Set up metrics, alerts, and log analytics to proactively identify and resolve issues.\n\n* Implement **security** measures: Apply security best practices to protect your Java application and the PostgreSQL database. This includes implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms with passwordless connections and leveraging Microsoft Defender for Cloud for threat detection and vulnerability assessments.\n\n* **Backup** your data: Azure Database for PostgreSQL provides automated backups by default.
